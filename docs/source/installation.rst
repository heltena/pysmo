Installation
============

We recommend not mixing pysmo with the system python, and instead installing it in a `Python virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_.
`Virtuelenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` is a convenient tool for creating and managing virtual environments.

Once the virtualenv is activated pysmo can be installed by running::

   pip install pysmo
